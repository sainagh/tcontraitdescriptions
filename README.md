# tcontraitdescriptions
Contenttweaker scripts that document all tinker's traits in minecraft 1.12!

If you see something is missing, feel free to ask me about it, or better, do a pull request!

Feel free to add this to your modpack, but please add a thank you note somewhere :)

Paste the .zs files in your scripts folder, and copy the lang lines into your pack's resource location!

Textures for each item are not available in this repository, but you can contact me if you are interested!
